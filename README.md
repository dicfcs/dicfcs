## Man Tek Ng `@dicfcs`

Hello, world! I am a third year Computer Systems Engineering student studying in the University of Warwick. I am originally from Macau ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡´.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as an intern at ARM! I've had the privilege to join their GPU Hardware Verification group for 2 years now.

I mainly work with SystemVerilog and Python but like to mess around with JS and web stuff.

My personal site is https://dicfcs.com, I host some kool stuff on there.

For CV, please head to https://cv.dicfcs.com or my LinkedIn bio ðŸ˜„.
